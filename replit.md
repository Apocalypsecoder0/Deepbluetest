## Overview

This is a modern web-based IDE built with React and Express, featuring a full-stack TypeScript architecture. The application provides a complete development environment with file management, code editing, terminal functionality, and project organization capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for IDE theming
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor integration for syntax highlighting and code editing

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with status code mapping
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite integration in development mode

### Data Storage Solutions

## Data Flow

1. **Project Loading**: Default project and files are loaded on IDE initialization
2. **File Operations**: CRUD operations flow through REST API to storage layer
3. **Editor State**: File content changes are tracked locally and synced on save
4. **Real-time Updates**: React Query provides optimistic updates and cache management

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
